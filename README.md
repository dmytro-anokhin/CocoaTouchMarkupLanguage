# CocoaTouchMarkupLanguage

Building Cocoa Touch apps using XML.

## Motivation

Over the long weekend I decided to hack a POC for the idea I had for long time. The idea is to build iOS app using XML format. Somehow mix of TVML and XIB's on macOS (with bindings).

## Demos

1. **EmptyView** is a view with `backgroundColor`  property.
2. **Countries** is a table view with `UIImageView` and `UILabel`. Images are sourced from iChat icons from the default location. They will only display in Simulator.
3. **SimpleForm** demonstrates binding using `UITextField` and `UILabel`.
4. **Festivals** uses real data by Amsterdam Marketing agency.
